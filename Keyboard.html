<h1>Membrane VS Ergonomic Keyboards</h1>

<p>September 2020
Many retro game enthusiasts would tell you that a Sony PVM (Professional Video Monitor) is
the pinnacle of the game displays that offers visuals of the highest calibre in contrast
precision and beauty. Built with probably the most advanced CRT technology ever created,
these monitors sell for a boatload, seeing that the CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) business is all
but dead since around the year 2010. Not to far before the demise of analog TV in the US.</p>

<p>The few odd parts of the room that have not been cornered by the LCD market are 1) legacy
airline industry 2) retrogaming and arcade enthusiasts. Sure enough, CRT has several
advantages for how old and outdated it may now appear, with it&rsquo;s large rear end and loud
eletric hum. Probably the most important point is its analog design. Without the need for
often slower digital memory for high resolution output, we have a zero-lag TV. It also
supports various analog quirks of older computers and video game consoles which targeted
analog signals.</p>
