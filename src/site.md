# This site is built on Markdown and some scripts. Pretty much ghetto Jekyll. 

## Static (The O.G) Websites

### Websites are text and multmedia files. When a user-agent (ie, Mosaic web browser) asks for resource via a request (HTTP GET), the server will attempt to transmit it.

#### Most websites from the 90s used this simple model. 
#### Websites had low footprint in response and resources
##### Try surviving on 16kb/s on modern websites
##### Some people still rely on satellite internet...

## Dynamic Websites 

### Dynamic websites operates when web resources are generated on the fly through code. The same URL can return different content depending on context. Usually, there exists a database where actual content is stored. 

### Most websites today are feature rich and use dynamic server backends to achieve this. You have newsfeeds, BBS forums, wikis, social media, online shops are driven by powerful server backends. 

#### Disadvantages
##### You need to setup and maintain an dynamic server which introduces attack vectors
##### and requires migration when updating 
##### You will need to learn to code for your website
##### You will need to learn to code *securely* and _always do so_
##### Your site response time becomes slower
##### Your site becomes more difficult to cache
  
#### Advantages
##### Your site will be feature rich
##### Your site will have bugs 


### For a personal site like this one, dynamic websites don't offer much. Simplicity is beautiful if only for the fact it saves on website maintenace headaches :P . 

### While browsers are increasingly becoming more sophisticated, running games and maybe even *entire operating systems* in the future, I remind people that they were simpler timeswhen a plain HTML page was all you needed to be heard.
