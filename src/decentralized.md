The centralization of the internet in terms of information storage (memory), communication
networks (traffic) and computational platforms (processing) leads to the corporate
monopolies uprooting individual ownership of both our data and commputation. 

The above statement is generally an extension of the ideals of free software movement
pioneered by Rachard M. Stallman. Stallman of course only applied this idea that software
(ie source code) should be available and accessible to study as copy as people are entitled 
to the behavior of  programs running on their own hardware. 

With hardware, when you purchase a car, no dealer is providing the service manual and the
internal operations of the car -- why should we have such a need for software? A car
manufacturer may claim the need to protect trade secrets or to prevent competitors from
repairing cars from their brand. 

With software, you have no physical item, rather you are only receiving a copy of a code
and given permission to use it. The Free Software Movement can be understood as a reaction
to agreesive software vendors like Microsoft who usher stark EULA agreements as a means to
raise profits by forbidding redistribution and licensing fees while also releasing a
obfuscated binary, instead of the source code. 

Somewhat of a bizarre consequence of only embracing free software means rejecting non-free
software. In this regard, Stallman has created a dogmatic list of software to "boycott"
and not use because of their non-free status. A class of boycotted applications includes
Software as a Service (SaaS).
